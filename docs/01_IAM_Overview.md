# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Overview  

## What is AWS IAM?  
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a service that helps securely control access to AWS resources. It allows users to manage permissions, authentication, and policies for AWS services.  

## Key Features of IAM  
- **Granular Access Control** – Define specific permissions for users and roles.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Adds an extra layer of security.  
- **Federated Access** – Supports external identity providers like Google, Okta, and Active Directory.  
- **Fine-Grained Permissions** – Users can have specific policies for different AWS services.  
- **Auditing & Compliance** – Integrates with AWS CloudTrail for monitoring access and compliance.  

## IAM Components  
1. **Users** – Individual identities with specific permissions.  
2. **Groups** – Collection of users with shared permissions.  
3. **Roles** – Temporary permissions assigned to users or services.  
4. **Policies** – JSON documents defining permissions.  
5. **Access Keys** – Used for programmatic access via AWS CLI or SDKs.  

## IAM Best Practices  
✔ **Enable MFA** for all users.  
✔ **Follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP)** – Grant only necessary permissions.  
✔ **Use IAM roles instead of access keys** for applications.  
✔ **Regularly audit IAM permissions** using IAM Access Analyzer.  
✔ **Rotate credentials** periodically to reduce security risks.  

### **Conclusion**  
IAM is a critical service for securing AWS resources, enabling organizations to define who can access what, and enforcing security best practices.
